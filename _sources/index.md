# Think Linear Algebra

*Think Linear Algebra* is a code-first, case-based introduction to the most widely used concepts in linear algebra, designed for readers who want to understand and apply these ideas — not just learn them in the abstract. Each chapter centers on a real-world problem like modeling traffic in the web, simulating flocking birds, or analyzing electrical circuits. Using Python and powerful libraries like NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and NetworkX, readers build working solutions that reveal how linear algebra provides elegant, general-purpose tools for thinking and doing.

This book is for readers who may have struggled with traditional math instruction, or who want a more intuitive, hands-on way to learn. By working in Jupyter notebooks, readers get instant feedback as they write code, run simulations, visualize results, and explore what-if scenarios. Rather than beginning with mathematical formalism, *Think Linear Algebra* starts with meaningful applications and builds up the theory when it's needed. The result is a uniquely practical and empowering introduction to linear algebra as a language for solving real problems.

Linear algebra is foundational for machine learning, scientific computing, and computer graphics — fields with enormous demand and growth. From search engines and GPS tracking to signal processing and structural engineering, linear algebra is the language behind many of the technologies that shape our world. This book shows you how to use it effectively in your own work.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this book, you'll be able to:

* Formulate real-world problems using vectors and matrices, and solve them using standard linear algebra algorithms
* Use Python effectively to simulate systems, compute projections, solve equations, and perform matrix decompositions
* Visualize mathematical concepts including vector spaces, transformations, and system behavior using interactive, code-driven examples
* Apply linear algebra tools in engineering, data science, graphics, robotics, and other computational domains
* Think computationally about mathematical problems and translate between mathematical notation and working code
