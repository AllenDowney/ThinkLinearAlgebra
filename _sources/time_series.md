# Time Series Analysis with StatsModels

This is the landing page for a tutorial on time series analysis, based on [Chapter 12 of *Think Stats*](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkStats/chap12.html), third edition.


**Abstract**

Time series analysis provides essential tools for modeling and predicting time-dependent data, especially data exhibiting seasonal patterns or serial correlation. This tutorial covers tools in the StatsModels library including seasonal decomposition and ARIMA. We'll develop the ARIMA model bottom-up, implementing it one piece at a time, and then using StatsModels. As examples, we'll look at weather data and electricity generation from renewable sources in the United States since 2004 -- but the methods we'll cover apply to many kinds of real-world time series data.

## The notebooks

For each part of the tutorial, there are two notebook: the first contains
blank cells for code-along activities and exercises; the second has all of
the code and solutions to the exercises.
